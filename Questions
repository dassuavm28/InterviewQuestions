public List<String> findClosestAddresses(File addresses, String hotelAddres) {}; 
The problem to solve was, how would you read the file and write the solution to find closest addresses to the given address. No API's given nothing, you basically can use whatever you want, I believe they want to see how you approach this problem. Again depends on which approach you choose and you and interviewer will decide on the file structure and how to extract the distance. Once you agree on this you start implementing the business logic for returning the List<String> of closest addresses

$$ Capgemini UK interview
--------------------------------
1) What do you understand by multiple inheritance?
2) WHat is an interface default method?
3) Hands on programming challenge. Multiple implementaions and test those.
4) If two interfaces have the same default methods, with the same method signature, and you have one class that implements both the interfaces.
   Then which method will be executed by the class?
   
   Java 8 supports default methods where interfaces can provide a default implementation of methods. 
   And a class can implement two or more interfaces. In case both the implemented interfaces contain default methods with the same method signature, 
   the implementing class should explicitly specify which default method is to be used, or it should override the default method.

     Default ( singleton ) scoped.
        a) Which bean will be loaded first? Why?
        b) Each time there is a request, the prototype will be instantiated. But what will happen to the mother bean? Will it be instantiated 
           every time, or the same instance will ge used? 
        c) Let's say the School bean has getters and setters for the Student bean. Now if we call getStudent, what object will it return? Will it return

============================

CTS Off shore Questions
===========================

1)Explain Functional  interface, Default method, method reference?
2)How to overload and override main method in Java?

Yes, We can overload the main method in java but JVM only calls the original main method, it will never call our overloaded main method.

3)What will be the end result of .filter() operation in stream API?

Returns a stream consisting of the elements of [a given] stream that match the given predicate.
The filter method essentially selects elements based on a condition you provide. That's why the filter (Predicate condition) accepts a Predicate object, 
which provides a function that is applied to a condition. If the condition evaluates true, the object is selected. Otherwise, it will be ignored.

4)What is Predicate in java 8?
In Java 8, Predicate is a functional interface, which accepts an argument and returns a boolean. Usually, it used to apply in a filter for a collection of objects.

5)Different between finally and finalize?
6)Explain Optional of() method in Java with examples?

The of() method of java.util.Optional class in Java is used to get an instance of this Optional class with the specified value of the specified type.
// create a Optional
Optional<Integer> op = Optional.of(9455);
// print valuel
System.out.println("Optional: " + op);
Output: Optional: Optional[9455]

7)What happens when we declare a thread inside main method in java, what are the active threads are there in the program?
8)Explain @SpringbootApplication annotation?
9)Advantage and disadvantage of resttemplate and feignclient?


Using Feign-clients over rest-templates has number of advantages. I will list down those below.
The developer need not worry about the implementation. Just to create abstract Feign interface and few annotations - declarative principle. (If you want customized configuration, then it will hold some code)

• With Spring Cloud Eureka, Ribbon client-side load-balancer will be equipped with Feign client.
• No need to worry about the unit test, because there is no implementation from you to test. (Arguable)
• Supports Feign annotations and JAX-RS annotations.
• Highly compatible and easily configurable with Spring Cloud (Specially with Eureka server registry)
• Allows Feign client configuration via @Configuration class or application properties.
• Allows us to add interceptors. (Add interceptors via @Configuration or application properties. Alternatively can use Spring Cloud provided interceptors as well. 
Example - BasicAuthRequestInterceptor)
• Hystrix support for fall-back mechanism.
• Logging
• Error handling
Feign is a good choice, If you are fascinated with JPA and the way how it resolves your queries, 
then Feign is the tool for you. Feign will handle your server requests perfectly fine.
RestTemplate is used for making the synchronous call. When using RestTemplate, the URL parameter is constructed programmatically, 
and data is sent across to the other service. In more complex scenarios, we will have to get to the details of the HTTP APIs provided by 
RestTemplate or even to APIs at a much lower level.Feign is a Spring Cloud Netflix library for providing a higher level of abstraction over 
REST-based service calls. Spring Cloud Feign works on a declarative principle. When using Feign, we write declarative REST service interfaces at the client, 
and use those interfaces to program the client. The developer need not worry about the implementation ...

10)Explain springboot Actuator?
11)How to Changing the Logging Level at the Runtime for a Spring Boot Application?

We're going to start by using the /loggers Actuator endpoint to display and change our logging level. 
The /loggers endpoint is available at actuator/loggers and we can access a specific logger by appending its name as part of the path.
For example, we can access the root logger with the URL http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/root.
To change the logging level, we can issue a POST request to the /loggers endpoint:
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"configuredLevel": "TRACE"}' http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/com.baeldung.spring.boot.management.logging HTTP/1.1 204 Date: Mon, 02 Sep 2019 13:56:52 GMT

12)Can we use .yml and .properties  both in single springboot  application?

Yes You can use both at same time in same project.
When you use both YML and properties at same time, say for example
application.yml and application.properties at same time in same
project, first application.yml will be loaded later
application.properties will be loaded.
Important point to be noted is that if application.yml and application.properties have same keys 
for example in application.yml has spring.app.name = testYML and application.properties has spring.app.name = testProperties at same time in same project, 
then application.yml value will be overwritten by application.properties value since it is loading at last.
And the value in spring.app.name = testProperties.


=============================================
Ericsson - Kolkata - First Round
=============================================

1) What is the new change brought in terms of memory in java 8?

Simply put, Metaspace is a new memory space – starting from the Java 8 version; it has replaced the older PermGen memory space. The most significant difference is how it handles memory allocation.
Specifically, this native memory region grows automatically by default.We also have new flags to tune the memory:

MetaspaceSize and MaxMetaspaceSize – we can set the Metaspace upper bounds.
MinMetaspaceFreeRatio – is the minimum percentage of class metadata capacity free after garbage collection
MaxMetaspaceFreeRatio – is the maximum percentage of class metadata capacity free after a garbage collection to avoid a reduction in the amount of space
Additionally, the garbage collection process also gains some benefits from this change. The garbage collector now automatically triggers the cleaning of the dead classes once the class metadata usage reaches its maximum metaspace size.

Therefore, with this improvement, JVM reduces the chance to get the OutOfMemory error.

2) What are the different lifecycle stages of a JSF managed bean?
	In execute phase, when first request is made, application view is built or restored. 
	For other subsequent requests other actions are performed like request parameter values are applied, 
	conversions and validations are performed for component values, 
	managed beans are updated with component values and application logic is invoked.

	The execute phase is further divided into following subphases.

	Restore View Phase

4) How we can achive security in REST api?
5) How security is implemented in your current project?
6) In terms of memory what is the changes brought in java 8?
	Simply put, Metaspace is a new memory space – starting from the Java 8 version; it has replaced the older PermGen memory space. The most significant difference is how it handles memory allocation.
	Specifically, this native memory region grows automatically by default.
	We also have new flags to tune the memory:
	MetaspaceSize and MaxMetaspaceSize – we can set the Metaspace upper bounds.
	MinMetaspaceFreeRatio – is the minimum percentage of class metadata capacity free after garbage collection
	MaxMetaspaceFreeRatio – is the maximum percentage of class metadata capacity free after a garbage collection to avoid a reduction in the amount of space
	Additionally, the garbage collection process also gains some benefits from this change. The garbage collector now automatically triggers the cleaning of the dead classes once the class metadata usage reaches its maximum metaspace size.
	Therefore, with this improvement, JVM reduces the chance to get the OutOfMemory error.

LabVantage
------------------------------------------------
1)Can we override private and static methods? NO

2)We have overloaded functions and we are passing null. 
Which function will be called and what will be the output of the program?

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		foo(null);
	}
	public static void foo(Object o) {
		System.out.println("Object argument");
	}
	public static void foo(String s) {
		System.out.println("String argument");
	}
}

Ans: According to Java specs, in case of overloading, the compiler picks the most specific function. 
Obviously String class is more specific than Object class, hence it will print “String argument”.

3)Please sort an array in decending order : int[] myArray = {8,5,2,9,6};

Ans:
private static void sortArray() {
// declaring and initializing the array
int[] arr = new int[] {8,5,2,9,6};

int temp = 0;

	// traverse 0 to array length
	for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {

		// traverse i+1 to array length
		for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {

			// compare array element with
			// all next element
			if (arr[i] < arr[j]) {

				temp = arr[i];
				arr[i] = arr[j];
				arr[j] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
	// print all element of array
	for (int value : arr) {
		System.out.println(value + " ");
	}
}

4)How to get distinct characters and their count in a String?
Input = "abcdABCDabcd";
Output =  {a=2, A=1, b=2, B=1, c=2, C=1, d=2, D=1}

Ans: with stream - string.chars().distinct().count();

private static void checkOccourenceOfCharaterInString() {
String s = "abcdABCDabcd";
Set<Character> set = new HashSet<Character>();
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i){
	char ch = s.charAt(i);
	if ((ch >= 65 && ch <= 90) || (ch >= 97 && ch <= 122))
		set.add(s.charAt(i));
}
System.out.println(set.size());
}

5)Java program to check if the given number is Prime?

Ans:
private static boolean isPrime(int n)
{
	// Corner case
	if (n <= 1)
		return false;

	// Check from 2 to n-1
	for (int i = 2; i < n; i++)
		if (n % i == 0)
			return false;
		else
			return true;

	return true;
}

Ans: A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
Examples of first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5,
% = Modulus operator , devides two numbers and returns the operator

6)Java Program to check if a vowel is present in the string?

String str = "GeeksForGeeks";
str = str.toLowerCase();

// toCharArray() is used to convert
// string to char array
char[] chars = str.toCharArray();

int count = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
	// check if char[i] is vowel
	if (str.charAt(i) == 'a' || str.charAt(i) == 'e' || str.charAt(i) == 'i' || str.charAt(i) == 'o'
			|| str.charAt(i) == 'u') {
		// count increments if there is vowel in
		// char[i]
		count++;
	}
}

// display total count of vowels in string
System.out.println("Total no of vowels in string are: " + count);

7)What will be the output of the program?
String x = "abc";
String y = "abc";
x.concat(y);
System.out.print(x.concat(y));


8)EMP table
empid empname deptid salary
E1	  Saibal  D1     1000000

E4    Tapas   D2     4500000
E5    Kamal   D2     90000000

Find the number of employees in each department along with the department code. Below is the required output
Deptid Number of employees
D1     3
D2     2


SELECT deptid, COUNT(*) FROM EMP GROUP BY deptid;

9) What is singleton design pattern ?Write a singleton class?

4) How hashset works internally and doesnot take duplicate objects?
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-working-of-sethashset-in-java/
	Now as you can see that whenever we create a HashSet, it internally creates a HashMap and if we insert an element into this HashSet using add() method, 
	it actually call put() method on internally created HashMap object with element you have specified as it’s key and constant Object called “PRESENT” as it’s value. 
	So we can say that a Set achieves uniqueness internally through HashMap.
